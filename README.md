# Lab04PetStore
Inheritance/overwriting Application Lab

Make mermaid js to show inheritance relationship for lab

Base class: pets
Inheritting classes: cat, dog, hamster
//getters/setters for name and breed--these are simply inheritted by other classes
//makeNoise -- to be overwritten
//each animal gets at least one special task that it can do--dogs fetch, cats chase mice, hamsters run on wheels
//Maybe they have to make a function for main that generates an array list of pets or something
//Either that or maybe cat uses array lists/regular arrays to store mice it has caught


Alternatively--
Base class: clowns
Inherritting classes: Sad (clown), Happy (clown)
